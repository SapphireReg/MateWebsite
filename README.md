--- About the Website ----
MATE is a made-up company our group came up. The company has "MATE"s which are basically friends-for-hire to accompany people at certain events or activities. May it be gaming, outdoor activities, sports & recreation, and the like. 

The website's primary function is to allocate a MATE based on the details provided by the user. It runs a algorithm/script that matches a user to our compatible MATEs and outputs the top 3. To test it out, please fill out the booking form.

This project was uploaded upon completion with a few additional documents added for informational support.
